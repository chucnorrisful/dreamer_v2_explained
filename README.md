# DreamerV2: Mastering ATARI with Model-based Reinforcement Learning [explained]
_University Seminar Paper_

## Abstract:
The algorithm DreamerV2 presents a recent breakthrough in the field
of model-based reinforcement learning, reaching state-of-the-art perfor-
mance on the popular ATARI Learning Environment benchmark. This
seminar paper gives an overview over model-based reinforcement learn-
ing, shows the predecessors of DreamerV2 and explains the algorithm and
neural-network architecture in detail. The results, possible applications
and the features of model-based reinforcement learning are discussed.
